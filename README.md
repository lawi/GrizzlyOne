# GrizzlyOne
Chess project for AVR 

## History
This project is a long term wish to be completed at any time. It is born in the good old 80s 
when chess computers had 8-bit CPUs and play awful chess. <br>
The goal is to build a chess computer with 8-bit hardware which plays at least equal to those old
machines in times where men won nearly all games.<br>
<br>

The code is not complete. <br>

- the chess rules are implemented
- it hangs when thinking a little deeper when one move
- evaluation is not good

## Two souls
<b>AVR</b>
The chess program is mainly developed to run on an AVR on a self made hardware.
To find out more visit www.slengo.de and look for GrizzlyOne.
The hardware is open source. It is a little chess computer with baord based on an AVR.
<br><br>
<b>Computer</b> 
It will be possible to test the chess engine on Linux, Windows or anywhere else with gcc and make tools.
The enigine will get a winboard interface to be tested with some chess frontends.
<br><br>
But it is not finished yet. So just wait and keep it watching.
